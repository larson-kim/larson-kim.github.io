## Sanctuary Policy Exploration
Collaborator: [Connor Warren (they/them)](https://github.com/MarcusApollo7).

**Project description:** The question we intend to explore is, “What underlying patterns are associated with the counties implementing sanctuary policies?” To answer this question, information about county demographics, policies in place for the counties, and the political affiliation of elected officials was collected and organized in a relational database.


### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Immigration policy is, in theory, determined by weighing the perceived costs of having someone immigrate to an area (housing shortages, marginal crime increases, etc.) over the perceived benefits of having them participate in the economy (by paying tuition, contributing to the labor market, improving demand for local consumer markets, etc.) 


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
