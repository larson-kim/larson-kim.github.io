  <B>Survey Geek, Neighborhood Nerd</b><br><br>
  I'm a community advocate and survey enthusiast with a background in market research and economic development.
  I'm the VP of Insights at <a href="https://www.luminoso.com/">Luminoso</a>, an AI text analytics company founded out of the MIT Media Lab. 
  I love turning challenges into opportunities, building strong, trust-based relationships through collaboration, and thrive in creative, hands-on environments.
  <br><br>
  My ongoing passion projects include the Portland Neighborhood Culture Study Series, a self-started initiative rooted in community insight and professional growth.
  I'm always open to connecting and exploring ways to contribute meaningfully to mission-driven teams.<br>
